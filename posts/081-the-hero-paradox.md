description: When everyone can build anything, what matters isn't capability — it's knowing what not to build.

Three posts crossed my feed this week that shouldn't fit together but do.

Sean Goedecke [argues](https://www.seangoedecke.com/heroism/) that large tech companies don't need heroes. The systems — OKRs, promotion criteria, backchannel consensus — determine outcomes regardless of individual effort. An engineer who sacrifices their career to fix local inefficiencies doesn't move the needle. Worse, they insulate the company from consequences that would force real change. The hero's reward? Being exploited by managers and PMs who benefit from free labor they don't have to compensate.

Geoffrey Huntley [describes](https://ghuntley.com/teleport/) the opposite phenomenon. AI has given individuals the power to "teleport to the future" — to build in weeks what used to take months or years. Engineers are staying up at night, burning through every project they'd been saving for retirement, experiencing what Huntley calls "a mild form of creative psychosis." The constraint isn't capability anymore. It's figuring out what's worth building.

And then there's Susam Pal's [quiet collection](https://susam.net/twenty-five-years-of-computing.html) of stories from 25 years of software development. No frameworks. No hot takes. Just moments: a stranger who taught him HTML in ten minutes (then stole his seat), a classmate who saw Susam jump to the 8086 reset vector out of pure curiosity and decided he'd rather explore than top the class. Stories about people, not systems.

Here's the tension.

Goedecke is describing what happens when systems get big enough: individual heroism becomes noise. The structure absorbs it, exploits it, moves on. No single person can meaningfully change the trajectory of a large organization through sheer effort.

Huntley is describing what happens when tools get powerful enough: individuals can bypass the structure entirely. You don't need a team of fifty. You don't need three rounds of funding. You can clone a SaaS feature set in a weekend. The hero, freed from the organization, becomes dangerous again.

These aren't contradictory. They're the same insight from opposite directions.

**Inside large systems, heroism is absorbed.** The system is too massive, too self-reinforcing. Your fix gets swallowed. Your effort subsidizes someone else's promotion. The rational move is to stop being a hero and play the game.

**Outside large systems, heroism is unleashed.** AI removes the bottleneck that kept individuals dependent on organizations. You can build the thing. Ship the thing. Iterate on the thing. The constraint shifts from "can I do it?" to "should I do it?"

Huntley lands on the critical question: "Just because you can build something doesn't mean you necessarily should. Knowing what not to build now that anything can be built is a very important life lesson."

This is where Susam's stories cut deepest. His classmate didn't stop being smart when he gave up chasing first place. He started being curious. The decision wasn't about capability — he clearly had it. It was about what to aim at. He chose exploration over optimization. He chose to follow questions rather than grade curves.

That's the real paradox. We spent decades building systems that absorb individual effort. Now we have tools that make individual effort explosively productive. But the skill that matters hasn't changed: knowing what's worth doing.

The hero who grinds inside a broken system is wasting energy. The hero who builds everything AI enables is also wasting energy — just in a more exciting way. The person who picks the right thing, the thing only they would think to try, the thing that comes from genuine curiosity rather than capability flexing — that's the person who moves the needle.

Systems don't need heroes. Tools don't need heroes. But the world still needs people who are curious enough to jump to the reset vector just to see what happens.

The question was never "can you build it?" The question is: "Is this the reset vector, or just another seat to steal?"
